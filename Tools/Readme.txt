Working for Firmware 1.0.4 , TomatoOS. 


**BGM Start /Stop**
Start or Stop BGM based on current theme you are on
Notes: 
1. If you change theme, it will take the previously Start/Stop bgm values for that theme you swapped to. 
 

**BGM Swap**
Swap bgm is from Root of SDCARD  (/mnt/SDCARD/bgm.mp3 ), please name it bgm.mp3

Notes:
1. This will also replace the bgm based on whichever theme you are using. (default as well). 
2. One first run, the current BGM will be changed to bgm-bak. Running the script twice wiil cause the bgm-bak to be overridden with the new BGM, essentially losing your original's current BGM
