Any Icon design are welcome (i just randomly did some using Canva) or Bug reports are welcome

Tested on Firmware 1.0.4

Heavily took inspiration from the legends -> [DJware's](https://github.com/djware/TrimUITools?tab=readme-ov-file) TrimUI Tools & 
[Steve Laminger aka TechToyTinker's](https://techtoytinker.com/handheld-corner) TomatoOS files

Will be working on:
1. Backup configuration (RA/PPSSPP & customisation)
2. Restore configuration (RA/PPSSPP & customisation)
3. Breathing LED script
