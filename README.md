# TrimUI-Apps
Apps for TrimUI Smart Pro

Tested on Firmware 1.0.4

Heavily took inspiration from the legends -> [DJware's](https://github.com/djware/TrimUITools?tab=readme-ov-file) TrimUI Tools & 
[Steve Laminger aka TechToyTinker's](https://techtoytinker.com/handheld-corner) TomatoOS files

Will be working on:
- [x] Backup configuration (RA/PPSSPP/NDS )
- [x] Restore configuration (RA/PPSSPP/NDS )
- [ ] Breathing LED script
- [ ] Auto play next bgm in folder if any



Ps: Any Icon design are welcome (i just randomly did some using Canva),  Bug reports are welcome too
