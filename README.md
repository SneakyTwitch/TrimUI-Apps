## Please note that this project is not maintained anymore. Please use CrossMix OS 


Heavily took inspiration from the legend -> [DJware's](https://github.com/djware/TrimUITools?tab=readme-ov-file) TrimUI Tools & 
the usage of [Steve Laminger aka TechToyTinker's](https://techtoytinker.com/handheld-corner) TomatoOS files, additional tools such Dingux file commander

Will be working on:
- [x] Backup configuration (RA/PPSSPP/NDS )
- [x] Restore configuration (RA/PPSSPP/NDS )




Ps: Any Icon design are welcome (i just randomly did some using Canva),  Bug reports are welcome too
